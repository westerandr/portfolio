      `I've been fascinated with computers and software since I was 5 years old. Growing up, I have always had computers and applications in the back of my mind.`,
      `After receiving a fully funded scholarship to study Computer Science at Victoria University in Wellington NZ; it has helped me to understand the fundamentals of data structures and algorithms. This allowed me to branch off into web development which I quite enjoyed and still do to this day.`,
      `I've been utilizing React, Vue, Bootstrap, Tailwind, Node.js, Express, Django, MongoDB, Flutter, MySQL, PHP, Wordpress, Nginx, Apache to name a few.`,
      `I can say confidently that I can build full stack web applications from start to finish either collaborating with a team or solo. Send me a message if our interests align`
